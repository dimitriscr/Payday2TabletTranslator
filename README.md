# Payday2TabletTranslator
A program that can translate payday 2's obsidian tablet and finds the matching achievement.

My friends and me recently got back into payday 2 and instead of each translating the 20 achievements manually, I quickly made a python program to do it. I know that the hype for payday 2 has died down a recently, but I thought that it might still be able to help someone, so here it is.

This program was made in less than 24hr and clearly examplifies function over form (it looks terrible), but it works.

Check releases for an exe that runs without needing to install python

Feel free to do anything you want with it, change it, post it places, etc...
